/**
 * App Component
 *
 * Root component that serves as the entry point for the application.
 * Currently renders the Notes Dashboard view directly.
 *
 * Future Enhancements:
 * - Add React Router for navigation between multiple views
 * - Implement protected routes with authentication guards
 * - Set up global theme provider (e.g., using ThemeProvider from styled-components)
 * - Add global error boundary to catch and display unhandled errors
 * - Add global state providers (e.g., user context)
 * - Set up analytics tracking
 * - Include accessibility enhancements
